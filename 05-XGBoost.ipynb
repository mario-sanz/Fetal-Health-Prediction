    "Sin embargo, en la matriz de confusión podemos ver que XGBoost sigue clasificando incorrectamente los mismos 3 casos que el árbol de decisión en la clase `Pathological`, dando el mismo valor de Recall en esta clase.\n",
    "\n",
    "El hecho de que tanto el árbol de decisión como XGBoost obtengan los mismos resultados en la clase `Pathological` puede ser porque estos 3 casos son muy difíciles de clasificar (son outliers en cuanto al valor de sus variables). Esto, junto con el hecho de que hay muy pocos datos de entrenamiento de esta clase, hace que el modelo no sea capaz de aprender a clasificarlos correctamente. Es decir, que ni siquiera un modelo más robusto y complejo como XGBoost es capaz de clasificar correctamente estos casos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Además, vemos que el número de pacientes `suspect` que son incorrectmente clasificados como `normal` es mayor en XGBoost que en el árbol de decisión (se incrementa en 3). Sin embargo, la clase `normal` es la más mejorada con el uso de XGBoost (mejora en 11 casos).\n",
    "\n",
    "En resumen, XGBoost obtiene mejore resultados que el árbol de decisión en cuanto al F1, pero el rendimiento identificando casos patológicos sigue siendo el mismo que para el árbol de decisión. Además, hemos visto que esta mejora en F1 viene principalmente dada por la mejora en la clase `normal`, que es la menos interesante de mejorar porque es la que menos problemas de salud tiene."

    "Los valores SHAP de cada variable nos muestran el impacto que tiene esa variable en la predicción del modelo por cada clase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Los resultados obtenidos para XGBoost son muy curiosos. Vemos que la variable con mayor impacto en la salida del modelo en general es `mean_value_of_short_term_variability`. Sin embargo, esta variable no tiene ningún impacto prácticamente sobre la clase \"Pathological\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Para predecir \"Pathological\", la variable con más impacto sobre la salida del modelo es `histogram_mean`, con mucha diferencia sobre las demás. Esto también era así para el árbol de decisión, por lo que, si nuestro objetivo fuera predecir correctamente los casos patológicos, esta sería la variable principal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Este análisis nos indica que habría que tener especial cuidado a la hora de tratar con este dato. Si no se dispusiera de él, habría que buscar una forma de obtenerlo o de estimarlo, ya que es la variable más importante para la predicción de casos patológicos.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusiones\n",
    "\n",
    "En este notebook hemos visto cómo aplicar XGBoost para clasificar los casos de nuestro dataset. Hemos visto que XGBoost obtiene mejores resultados que el árbol de decisión en cuanto al F1, pero el rendimiento identificando casos patológicos sigue siendo el mismo que para el árbol de decisión.\n",
    "\n",
    "Además, XGBoost consigue un rendimiento de F1 ligeramente inferior que la red neuronal. Sin embargo, la red neuronal tarda más en entrenar (25 segundos de la red neuronal frente a 0.51 segundos de XGBoost) y es más compleja de interpretar que XGBoost, por lo que con XGBoost ganamos rapidez y explicabilidad."
